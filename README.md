issue \#31 -- There are 2 unique codeStem ids that are found in the trait data (xrf sample names) and the sequence data, but not in the stemSamples data (deployment sample names). These codeStem ids are not found in the percent mass loss data. Because the main goal is to analyze decay responses, I'm going to continue to leave these codeStems out of the stemSamples dataframe. Is it possible that stem id numbers got switched? Something to follow-up on.

Wood traits as a predictor
==========================

We expect initial wood traits will explain varitation in species+size decay rate (k and t70), species+size lagginess (alpha), and stem-level percent mass remaining at 7, 13, 25, and 37 months of decay. Specifically, we expect samples with (a) high water percent, (b) low density and total C, (c) high macro and micro nutrients, and (d) thicker bark (potential mech: limiting microbial colonization) to have faster decay and less lagginess.

*Hyp (species+size-level)* Species+size-level initial wood traits will predict variation decay rates and lagginess.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Hyp (stem-level)* Stem-level initial wood traits will predict variation in percent mass loss at each time step.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we need to decide what trait data (and samples) to include in this analysis since we don't have full coverage of stem-level trait data. Density and bark thickness were only measured on small sized stems. If there is not be very much within-species variation in these traits that contribute to variation in percent mass loss than we can justify including species-level estimates of these traits in the stem-level model.

Compare model fits (r2) using stem and species-level data to identify how much information about percent mass remaining is lost by using species-level estimates...For density, it looks like stem-level data improves model fit a tiny bit for early percent mass remaining time points (after 7 and 13 months) but not later time points. For barkthickness, fits are about the same.

Stem-level density estimates provide additional information about mass loss beyond code-level density at time7 and time 59. Stem-level bark thickness estimates are not useful (beyond code-level bark thickness) at any time point.

Compile a "stem-level" dataframe with (a) stem-level percent mass remaining values, (b) stem-level traits including waterperc and chemistry along, and (c) small species-level density and bark thickness data.

Community as a predictor
========================

Filter community matrix to include only taxa that are present in a least 20% of all the samples. This step removes taxa that may not contribute much to our understanding of the relationship between speciesâ€™ multivariate abundance and environment.

Many of the bottom 1% OTUs are classified as saprotrophs. That makes sense since low WA-PLS scores indicate an association with high mass loss (i.e. less mass remaining) at time37.

But saprotrophs are also found at many points along the gradient... ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png)

Is this because there is an underlying signature of wood traits on the initial microbial community that is driving the relationship between the community and the mass remaining after 37 months? The next analysis ("Community+traits" as predictor) will test this formally. Just out of curiousity, I'd like to pull in OTU "niche" info from the boral analysis to see if there's a relationship between OTU WA-PLS scores and wood trait coeffient estimates.

Reminder of which wood traits were included in the best model to explain pmr at time37...

There's a weak negative relationship between an OTU's WA-PLS score and waterperc coefficient (slope=-2.3, p=.03), suggesting that OTUs that "prefer" high-water niche space are associated with less mass remaining at time37.

Community+traits as a predictor

Community data doesn't improve our understanding of decay rates (k, t70) or variation in decay rate (ne.r2) beyond what is known from the trait data.

*Hyp (stem-level)* After accounting for variation in decay due to wood traits (no models with density, includes small-species level bark thickness), stem-specific initial microbial communitiy compositions will predict variation in percent mass loss, particularly in the early stages of decay.

Hyp-Alt: Greater saprotroph and basidiomycete richness will lead to worse-fitting decay models (ne.r2), slower decay (k), and more lagginess (alpha) because decayers will be allocating more of their resources to combat one another. \#\# *Hyp-c (species+size-level)* Greater pathogen and oomycete richness will lead to worse-fitting decay models (ne.r2), slower decay (k), and more lagginess (alpha) because the presence of these organisms will inhibit the establishment and activity of decayers.

A couple of models were informative, particularly for time37. Saprotroph OTU richness is associated with percent mass remaining at time25 and time37. Pathogen OTU richness and Shannon's H are associated with pmr at time 37. In all cases, there is a negative interaction between stem size and diversity.

Plot the relationship between Shannon's H and pmr at time37 ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png) Higher Shannon's H leads to less mass remaining in small stems, more mass remaining in large stems... but these are pretty weak relationships.

Beyond wood trait data, saprotroph richness improves models for k and t70. In addition, pathotroph richness improves the model for ne.r2.

Plot the relationship between Saprotroph richness and k ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png) Higher saprotroph richness leads to faster decay than would be expected based on wood traits alone.

Plot the relationship between Saprotroph richness and t70 ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png) Higher saprotroph richness leads to shorter times to 70% mass remaining than would be expected based on wood traits alone.

Plot the relationship between Saprotroph richness and beta ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png) Higher saprotroph richness leads to shorter times to 70% mass remaining than would be expected based on wood traits alone.

Plot the relationship between Pathotroph richness and ne.r2 ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png) Higher pathotroph richness leads to better-fitting decay models than would be expected based on wood traits alone.

*Hyp (stem-level)* After accounting for variation in decay due to wood traits, initial microbial diversity (richness, Shannon diversity, ... add phylogenetic diversity) will predict variation in percent mass loss, esp. at early time points.

Overall OTU richness improves model estimates for percent mass remaining at 25 months. Pathotroph richness improves model estmates for pmr at 37 months.

Plot the relationship between OTU richness and residuals of pmr at time25 ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png) In small stems, more fungal OTUs leads to less mass remaining after 25 months than would be expected based on wood traits alone. This relationship looks heavily influenced by 1 outlier w/ high OTU richness

Plot the relationship between Pathotroph OTU richness and residuals of pmr at time37 ![](readme_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png) In small stems, more pathotrophs leads to less mass remaining after 37 months than would be expected based on wood traits alone.

Extra pieces
------------

1.  *code/testing\_time\_zero.Rmd* -- Including t=0 points to fit decay model affects the liklihood and the model selection criteria, but the curve fits are identical with this formulation. Excluding the t=0 fits has an effect of prefering simpler models, which is the same effect as increasing the penalty for model complexity.

2.  *code/initialDist\_vs\_decayDist\_btwCode.Rmd* -- No apparent relationship between species+size dissimilarities in initial microbial community composition (bray and jaccard) and decay trajectory params

3.  *code/boralOTUpairs\_vs\_decay.Rmd* -- No apparent relationship between frequency of boral-ID'd positively/negatively correlated OTU pairs and decay params

4.  *code/withinInitialDist\_vs\_decayR2.Rmd* -- No apparent relationship between initial microbial diversity WITHIN species+size and decay model R2

5.  *code/unexpectedTaxa.Rmd* -- Mycorrhizal fungi and animal-associated fungi that somehow made it into our OTU table
